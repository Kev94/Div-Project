        <b>Five Ways a Programmer Should Think:</b>
        <br>
        <br>
    <div>
        <b>Procedural Thinking:</b>
        <p>A programmer should break problems down into
           steps/procedures to solve problems more efficiently.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>Abstract Thinking:</b>
        <p>Essentially <em>finding similarity/generality</em>
           among seemingly <em>different</em>things.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>Systematic Debugging:</b>
        <p>Creates an opportunity for a programmer
           to <em>identify problems, find the causes of such problems,
           and finally fix those problems.</em>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>Technological Empathy</b>
        <p>The computer is written in a different language, called
        <em>machine language</em> that is different than human language.
            So one must understand how the <em>computer sees things</em> to
            be able to communicate properly with it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>Systems Thinking</b>
        <p>Lastly, a programmer should take a big idea and break it down
           into it's component pieces to code efficiently and correctly.
        </p>

      <h2>What is the <em>World Wide Web</em></h2>
    </div>
        <br>
    <div>
        <p>The web is a collection of html documents connected with <b>hyperlinks</b>
           that essentially glue everything together.  There are <em>five components
           of the web</em> that are essentially to its functionality.  They include,
        <b>the user, their computer, running a web browser, the internet, and
           servers</b>.  One can read about the creater of the web and how it became
           so crucial society at this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006251587X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Link</a>.
           You can view his picture <a href="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/images/2013/20130318105145-1_0.jpg">here</a>.
           He essentially enabled the web to be formatted through html language.

        <b>HTML Basics</b>
        <br>
        <em>Tags and Elements:</em>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A tag allows for the altercation of a html document.  For example,
           if I wanted to <b>bold the rest of the sentence I would use a bold
           tag</b> or if I wanted to <em>italicize something, I would use the
           emphasis tag</em>.  If I wanted to create a link to another page for
           additional information I would use the a tag.  You <b>must</b> close
           the tags so that they dont affect the whole document, unless it's a
           <em>void tag</em>, which does not have any content.  For example, image
           tags and break tags are void tags.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Another important concept in html are <b>container elements</b>, which
          are elements that have no other purpose but to contain stuff within them.
          There are two types of elements: <em>Inline and Block</em>.  Inline elements
          and tags include:<br>
          <b>span, br, em, img, a, and strong</b>.
          These inline elements and tags <em>keep everything on the same line,
          except for br</em>.
          <br>
          On the contrary, block elements and tags are more of space occupying objects.
          They include: <br>
          <b>form, p, and div</b>
          <br>
          Blocks are more for seperation of objects and basically draws an invisible
          container around the element or tag.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Conlusion</h3>
        <p>As a programmer one should keep their coding area clean by <b>practicing
        good indentation</b> so that others can read the code as well.  As the
        idea <em>begins</em> the indentation should increase and when the idea
        <em>ends</em> the indentation level should decrease.  Also don't forget
        to structure the html document correctly!!
